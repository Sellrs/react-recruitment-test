## Sellrs react recruitment test

Create a web application that allows to search Github users to have a peek on their activity.

The requirements of the application are described as following:

### Story:
```
As a User
I want to search GitHub users by their name
So I can find people that I know
```

### Story:

```
As a User
I want to see the user's avatars
So I it helps me to identify them
```

### Story:
```
As a User
I want to see the user's activity
So I can view their commit history
```

#### Considerations:
- You will be expected to use React in your solution
- The user interface is up to your choice
- We will look for error handling but we are not expecting all edge cases to be covered 
- Using Typescript is a plus
- Using a responsive design is a plus
- Adding tests is not mandatory, but is a big plus
- Provide a Readme to explain how to run the app and how to run the tests (in case they are present)
